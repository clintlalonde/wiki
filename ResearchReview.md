# Summary
A systematic review of 17 peer-reviewed studies of ed tech interventions and their impact on traditionally underserved students  (identified in the report as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latinex, Latino or Latina, Native or Indigenous American, including American Indian, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander) enrolled in a 2 or 4 year public or private institution in the U.S. Useful as the review illustrates effective practices that can be incorporated elsewhere.

# Findings
## Course Materials
- Students wished for more culturally inclusive material and curriculum that provided
opportunities to express their identity.
- OER helped students engage with the content, participate in the course, and complete assignments.

## Modality
- Under certain circumstances, students were more likely to succeed in blended and online courses than in their face-to-face (face-to-face) counterparts. Blended entry level STEM courses and online upper level courses improved outcomes.
- Do not overload courses. Students who are high academic achievers with large course loads are less likely to complete online courses and are at higher risk of dropping out
-  students reported that they liked their online courses because of  the non-prejudicial nature that provided a supportive and encouraging environment, rather than competition among peers, and the freedom to go at their own pace

## Instructional Design
- course structure and design can influence student success
- students have an even greater success (compared to blended/online success) when the courses are well structured or when they are part of the student’s degree program
- courses were designed using an **active learning pedagogy** approach that focused on **enhancing student engagement and interactions with each other and the material** rather than focusing on lecture-based instruction
-  The manner in which students discussed their satisfaction with the convenience of having all the course materials organized pragmatically in one location
- Research indicates that students require interactions with their instructors
and with each other to improve their learning and other outcomes
- Students reported they encountered learning challenges because they were not provided enough examples, timely feedback or response to questions, instructor-directed instructions, and general instructor interaction
-  Students need interaction with instructors to clarify expectations, including clear instructions and examples, and to provide timely and meaningful feedback to correspondence and assessments

## Collaborative Learning
-  collaborative learning is a potentially effective instructional and pedagogical approach to improve student outcomes. Students report satisfaction with online collaborative activities.
- students prefer to work in smaller groups than with the entire class

## Student level characteristics
- students reported that previous academic success (e.g., dual enrollment) and
previous technology experience (e.g., courses, technology familiarity) influenced their success
- Students need interventions to ready them for online learning. Interventions (study guides, online preparation opportunity, computer application course, and a more advanced technology course to help students develop technological skills needed for their coursework) to prepare students to gain the skills needed to be successful in courses using educational technologies have shown a positive impact on outcomes.
- Students taking a supplemental series of online preparation modules changed their study behaviors, had a greater use of self-assessment quizzing than the control group, and outperformed on quizzes and exams compared to the control group
- research indicates that academic preparation and adaptive learning may impact student outcomes. For instance, a summer preparation course that uses adaptive learning may help students perform statistically better than students in a remedial course.
- an online preparatory short course that used OER for chemistry, students performed better in the subsequent course than those students who did not participate in the preparatory short course

# Notes
- as expected, US centric report
