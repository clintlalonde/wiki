# Summary
A systematic review of 17 peer-reviewed studies of ed tech interventions and their impact on traditionally underserved students (defined as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latinex, Latino or Latina, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander) enrolled in a 2 or 4 year public or private institution in the U.S. Useful as the review illustrates effective practices that can be incorporated elsewhere.

# Findings
## Course Materials
- Students wished for more culturally inclusive material and curriculum that provided
opportunities to express their identity.
- OER helped students engage with the content, participate in the course, and complete assignments.

## Modality
- Under certain circumstances, students were more likely to succeed in blended and online courses than in their face-to-face (face-to-face) counterparts. Blended entry level STEM courses and online upper level courses improved outcomes.
- Do not overload courses. Students who are high academic achievers with large course loads are less likely to complete online courses and are at higher risk of dropping out
-  students reported that they liked their online courses because of  the non-prejudicial nature that provided a supportive and encouraging environment, rather than competition among peers, and the freedom to go at their own pace

## Instructional Design
- course structure and design can influence student success
- students have an even greater success (compared to blended/online success) when the courses are well structured or when they are part of the studentâ€™s degree program
- courses were designed using an **active learning pedagogy** approach that focused on **enhancing student engagement and interactions with each other and the material** rather than focusing on lecture-based instruction
-  The manner in which students discussed their satisfaction with the convenience of having all the course materials organized pragmatically in one location
- Research indicates that students require interactions with their instructors
and with each other to improve their learning and other outcomes
- Students reported they encountered learning challenges because they were not provided enough examples, timely feedback or response to questions, instructor-directed instructions, and general instructor interaction
-  Students need interaction with instructors to clarify expectations, including clear instructions and examples, and to provide timely and meaningful feedback to correspondence and assessments

## Collaborative Learning
-  collaborative learning is a potentially effective instructional and pedagogical approach to improve student outcomes. Students report satisfaction with online collaborative activities.
- students prefer to work in smaller groups than with the entire class

# Notes
- as expected, US centric report
